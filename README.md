## The Stripe demo card is:

    4242 4242 4242 4242 | 123 | 1225

All payment intents are automatically accepted in test mode (Don't use your own credit Card).

## Verfication:

We use https://withpersona.com to verify out customers. Since it would cost 350â‚¬ Monthly to set up "real" verification, we are using the test mode, which works like the real verification process, but automatically accepts the verification.
